A Valorant themed game where the user must use fiducial markers to control their Mosh left and right to catch 5 Dizzys and 5 Wingmans. Once the player wins, they receive a trophy! This game was built using AR in p5.js. Dizzy, Mosh, and Wingman art is by me. All characters, weapons, and ideas in this game are owned by Riot Games.
